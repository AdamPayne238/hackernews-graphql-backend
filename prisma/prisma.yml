# The HTTP endpoint for your Prisma API

endpoint: https://us1.prisma.sh/adam-payne/hackernews-node/dev

# Points to the file that contains your datamodel

#Specifies language & location for the generated Prisma client

    output: ../src/generated/prisma-client

## Right now, it is a bit annoying that you need to explicitly run prisma generate every time youâ€™re migrating your database with prisma deploy. To make that easier in the future, you can configure a post-deployment hook that gets invoked every time after you ran prisma deploy.
hooks:
  post-deploy:
    - prisma generate
# The Prisma client will now automatically be regenerated upon a datamodel change.
